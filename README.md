# QUACKD-Bot: A Slackbot Interface powered by the B-92 Protocol

Our Slackbot interface gives users the freedom to send encrypted messages to invididuals or groups, protected by custom quantum keys generated through the B92 protocol. Our high-level, user-friendly interface is accessible to nontechnical users, and provides individuals with a robust and reliable path towards data security.

## Technical Overview:

**Slackbot interface** allows users to send and receive quantum keys generated via the B92 Protocol, encrypt messages, and send to individuals or groups.

**Randomized benchmarking** examines characteristics of noise channel.

**Measurement error mitigation** combats quantum readout noise.

**Information reconciliation**, **privacy amplification**, and **randomness extraction** guarantees key effectiveness and security.
