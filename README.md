# QUACKD-Bot: A Slackbot Interface powered by the B-92 Protocol

## Introduction

The development of quantum algorithms has simultaneously opened up avenues to break classical cryptographic codes and create new, powerful encryption schemes through the development of inherently quantum codes. This presents both a danger to existing encryption schemes and an opportunity to safeguard information to a much greater extent than previously possible.

Here, we create a Slackbot interface that generates quantum keys to encrypt Slack communications, both between individual users and in multi-user channels, through the B92 protocol. Our high-level interface allows users to initiate key generation from a set of simple and intuitive commands, and send separately encrypted messages to multiple users simultaneously.

## Team Members:

Jessie Chen, Nikhil Harle, Richard Li, Allen Mi, Will Sun (Yale University)

## How-To-Run

The project is developed under `x86-64` Linux. The system dependencies are as follows:

- `conda`: Anaconda or Miniconda, for managing the appropriate Python virtual environment

To install the Python dependencies, run
```
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```
at the root directory of the folder, followed by
```
conda activate quackd
```
to activate the virtual environment.

To populate the relevant credentials, navigate to the `credentials/` directory and make a copy of the template JSON files. Rename the copies `ibm.json` `qi.json` and `slack.json` respectively. Modify the files with your own credentials.

To run QUACKD-Bot, invoke `run_app.sh` in the root directory. The file contains instructions for performing B92 on various simulator and hardware backends.

## Technical Overview:

**Slackbot interface** allows users to send and receive quantum keys generated via the B92 Protocol, encrypt messages, and send to individuals or groups.

**Randomized benchmarking** examines characteristics of the qubit-specific noise channels.

**Measurement error mitigation** combats quantum readout noise.

**Information reconciliation** through the **Cascade** protocol, **privacy amplification**, and **randomness extraction** guarantees key effectiveness and security.

## Other Examples and Functionality: 

- ‘qkd-b92/B92_Circuit_Hardware.ipynb’ contains some examples which were not ultimately included in the Slackbot functionality, yet are of general or educational interest. For example, it contains:
  - An image which is successfully encrypted and decrypted using a distributed key that is repeated many times!
  - Example experiments demonstrating how the measurement error calibration matrices are formed on `Starmon-5` and `Spin-2` backends, as well as the creation of reconciled keys
  - Details on how the counts threshold for a given results dictionary determines Bob’s bit values

## Personal Experiences:

This was a really enjoyable and rewarding experience. We enjoyed the opportunity to reinforce our theoretical knowledge of QKD protocols by running B92 on actual quantum hardware, as well as the chance to practice characterizing errors on individual qubits and implementing complementary error correction protocols. We would like to thank the QuTech mentors for their dedication to helping participants through difficult portions of the challenge and making advice public on the Slack. Additionally, we would like to thank the iQuHACK team for their excellent organization and for making this event happen.
